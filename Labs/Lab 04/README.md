	OBJECT: Event handling in Javascript

	Assignments:
		1.Write a program to demonstrate page load event.

		2.Write JS code to illustrate element positioning, stacking elements and mouse cursor.

		3.Write JS function to validate a form input field for onblur event whether it is blank or not and contains number or not.

		4.Write JS code to find the factorial of a number requesting a number from user using prompt. Display result on button click.

		5.Create an HTML form that takes user's email address and password. Validate the form using JS when the submit button is clicked. Make sure that the fields are not empty and the email address is a valid email address.

THEORY:
	
	Form Validation using JavaScript:
		Forms are used in webpages for the user to enter their required details that further send it to the server for processing. A form is also known as a web form or HTML form. Examples of form use are prevalent in e-commerce websites, online banking, online surveys to name a few.

	onload Event:
		The onload event occurs when an object has been loaded.onload is most often used within the <body> element to execute a script once a web page has completely loaded all content (including images, script files, CSS files, etc.).The onload event can be used to check the visitor's browser type and browser version, and load the proper version of the web page based on the information.The onload event can also be used to deal with cookies.
	onblur Event:
		The onblur event occurs when an HTML element loses focus.The onblur event is often used on input fields.The onblur event is often used with form validation (when the user leaves a form field). 

CONCLUSION:
	Hence, we learned about various event handling functions in Javascript.
